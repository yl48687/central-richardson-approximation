# Central Richardson Approximation
This Java program accepts command-line arguments to approximate `f'(x)` for inputs `x` and `h`. It calculates and prints the central difference approximation, Richardson extrapolation approximation, and exact value of `f'(x)`.

## Design Overview
The program consists of a single class `CentralRichardsonApproximation` that calculates the central difference approximation, Richardson extrapolation approximation, and exact value of `f'(x)`.

## Functionality
`CentralRichardsonApproximation.java`:
- Accepts command line arguments for `x` and `h`.
- Calculates the central difference approximation, Richardson extrapolation approximation, and exact value of `f'(x)` based on the given inputs.
